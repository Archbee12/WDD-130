        <p class="about">About Me</p>
          <p>Debbie O'Cone is an aspiring software developer, a student of Brigham Young University Idaho majoring in Software Development. 
          I never really considered myself cognitively disable, despite how much I struggled to teach myself to code and without achieving much, I decided to study in BYU-I, but with a recent development I am glad to say I have achieved some major skills as a a front-end developer which has to do with HTML, Little of CSS  but also with a diverse range of skills in Python and Graphics Designing. I would say I have great skills with graphics, i.e, designing of logos, flyers, banners, etc. Over the past 3 years, I managed a cyber-cafe for 2 years, after studying desktop publishing and graphics designing. My expertise in the field of Graphics designing wasn't enough so I decided to learn programming, but it didn't go well as I wasn't focused. but with the help of BYU-Pathway, after learning of this great institution, I decided to give a go at it amd I glad I did. I'd registered for a whole lot of courses online, and this including, UI/UX Designs, where I learnt various of things, using Figma, I was in my 4 months of studying UI/UX where I decided to major in Software Development that will enable me to bring my designs to life.</p>
