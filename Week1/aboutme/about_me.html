        <h2> Deborah Okon </h2>
        <p> Goodday You all, I am Deborah, I just got engaged and planning to start a new family. I love technology a lot, I am a Graphics Designer, an aspiring UI/UX experts (Product designer), so technically if I am not designing, I'd probably be sleeping because I am not much of an outing person but with my fiancee all over me trying to get me out of the house is something I am enjoying doing. </p>
        
        <p>I am currently pursuing a career in software development as I would not just like to design but to also see my designs working in reality. I really look forward to collaborating with you all.</p>
